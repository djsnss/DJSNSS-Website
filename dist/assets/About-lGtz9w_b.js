Sanghvi College of Engineering commenced their journey in the year 2005 towards making each member of the unit a better citizen and therefore making India a better nation. The unit works for the all-round development of society, wherein they try to solve various issues ranging from socio-economic problems to the sustainability crisis caused by global warming that ails Mother Nature. We, at D.J. Sanghvi College of Engineering, believe that for every individual to be strong enough to face the challenges of today's world, they have to see and experience for themselves the problems and predicaments faced by society and work towards its betterment one step at a time. At DJS NSS, we nurture and encourage this process of self-transformation, which will help the students become resilient and unfaltering in the face of life, ultimately transforming them from the "Arjuna Syndrome" to being successful individuals. It also inspires the team's journey towards becoming a strong unit, contributing to the progress and development of our nation. Social growth aside, DJS NSS also encourages the students to bring about various technical advancements, wherever necessary and possible. We encourage the unit to mesh technology with the daily lives of the needy, thereby inculcating in them a sense of oneness with society as a whole. In all our efforts, we seek the Lord's Grace to keep us on the path of virtue, courage, and wisdom. May thy grace and blessings flow through us to the world around us in all our efforts to make better people, in addition to being quality engineers who can make a positive impact in our society and help build our nation in these ever-changing and challenging times.
